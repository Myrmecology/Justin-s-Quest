Justin's Quest - Text-based Adventure Game
Welcome to Justin's Quest, a captivating text-based adventure game where you embark on a thrilling journey to collect ancient artifacts, battle fierce enemies, and uncover the mysteries of a medieval castle. Developed in C++, this game offers a rich narrative and exciting gameplay mechanics.

Overview
In this game, you play as Justin, who wakes up in a cold, damp dungeon. Your quest? To collect all 10 ancient artifacts scattered across the castle, battling guards and solving puzzles along the way. Your final goal is to conquer the dragons of wisdom, retrieve the artifacts, and escape to a world of great wonder and paradise.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need to ensure that your development environment is set up to compile and run C++ programs. Specifically, you'll need a C++ compiler such as g++. Please follow the instructions below to get started.

Installing g++ Compiler
Windows: Download and install MinGW.

macOS: Install the Xcode command line tools by running xcode-select --install in your terminal.

Linux: Install g++ using your package manager, for example:

bash

sudo apt install g++
Compilation Instructions
To compile the game and generate an executable, follow the steps below.

1. Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt
Ensure you're in the project directory where the .cpp files are located.

2. Run the Compilation Command
In your terminal, use the following g++ command to compile the source files into an executable. This command will take the main.cpp, player.cpp, room.cpp, and enemy.cpp files and link them into a single executable named justinsQuest.

bash

g++ -o justinsQuest main.cpp player.cpp room.cpp enemy.cpp
This will produce an executable file called justinsQuest.

Note: You may need to adjust the file names based on your actual file names or paths.

Running the Game
Once the compilation is complete, you can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

On Windows:
bash

justinsQuest.exe
On macOS/Linux:
bash

./justinsQuest
